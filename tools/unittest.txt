UnitTest
========

The unittest tool runs tests and presents findings as xml.

Usage:
------
	php -q unittest.php -test <some-typeId> [-test <...> ...]
or:
	php -q unittest.php -dir <some-directory>

Commandline options:
--------------------
	-t or -test : add an ITestable typeId to test
	-d or -dir : add a directory to scan for ITestables

How it works:
-------------
1. Loop over every `ITestable` typeId given as argument to the
   `-test` option or collected from a `-dir` option on the
   commandline
2. Loop over every test method in the ITestable class
3. Write a small php file to the systems temp dir that starts
   loads up the framework and executes one test method on a
   fresh instance of the test class.
4. run the generated stub and collect output from the child
   process' commandline
5. present all results as xml on stdout
6. return an exitcode representing the number of failed tests.

Note that the exitcode represents the number of failed tests,
not the number of failed assertions.
